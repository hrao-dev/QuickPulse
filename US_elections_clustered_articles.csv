EPA At least 2.5 million Ukrainians live in Poland - making up nearly 7% of the country's total population

Svitlana says her daughter loved her school in Poland. ""Even when we moved to another area, she didn't want to change schools,"" says the 31-year-old Ukrainian mother. ""She liked it so much. There was no bullying."" Now she says the atmosphere at the school – and in Poland overall – has changed. ""Two weeks ago, she came home and said ""One boy said to me today, 'Go back to Ukraine'."" Svitlana was astonished. She is one of dozens of Ukrainians living in Poland who have told the BBC that anti-Ukrainian sentiment has risen considerably in recent months. Many described experiencing abuse on public transport, bullying in schools and xenophobic material online. A polarising presidential election campaign has added to the tension, with the first round of voting taking place on Sunday.

Svitlana says her daughter has been bullied at school for being Ukrainian

The day after Svitlana's daughter was told to go back to Ukraine, the abuse became even worse. ""Girls from the class above started complaining about her speaking Ukrainian. Then they pretended to fall to the ground shouting 'Missile! Get down!' and laughing,"" Svitlana says. ""She came home crying."" A Russian missile had slammed into Svitlana's hometown in Ukraine days before, killing scores of civilians, including children. Her daughter was traumatised. Svitlana – not her real name did not want to be identified as she fears reprisals. She showed us screenshots of messages with school staff where she complains about her daughter's treatment. She said she had noticed attitudes changing towards Ukrainians in other places, too: ""At work, many people have been saying Ukrainians come here and behave badly. And my Ukrainian friends say they want to go home because Polish people don't accept us. It's frightening to live here now."" According to government statistics, at least 2.5 million Ukrainians live in Poland, comprising almost 7% of the total population of Poland. When the full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022, there was an outpouring of compassion from Poles. ""It was amazing. Every day people were calling, asking, 'How can we help?'"" says activist Natalia Panchenko, head of the Warsaw-based 'Stand with Ukraine' Foundation.

Natalia Panchenko's organisation has seen a rise in anti-Ukrainian abuse online - and in real life

""Some of them organised humanitarian convoys or brought refugees here. They gave their houses, food, everything they have – and their hearts, too."" Three years later, Natalia says she believes the majority of Poles still support Ukraine. But some don't – and her organisation has noticed an upsurge of anti-Ukrainian online abuse that began several months ago. ""Then it started to come to real life,"" she says. ""Recently, we have more and more of these kinds of situations… xenophobic [abuse] of people working in shops or hotels just because they speak with a Ukrainian accent."" Natalia says that many Ukrainian refugees are traumatised. ""These groups of women and children are in Poland because of the war, very often their relatives are on the front line, in captivity or dead... and this is the group of people being targeted."" Research suggests that Poland's public opinion of Ukrainians is indeed worsening. According to a March 2025 poll by the respected CBOS Centre, just 50% of Poles are in favour of accepting Ukrainian refugees, a fall of seven percentage points in four months. Two years ago, the figure was 81%. Around a million Ukrainians are officially registered as having arrived after the start of the full-scale invasion. Poland spends 4.2% of its GDP on Ukrainian refugees.

EPA Presidential front-runner Rafal Trzaskowski is playing down his pro-Ukrainian credentials in the campaign

Ukraine has become a hot-button political issue in Poland's crucial presidential election campaign. Far-right populist Slawomir Mentzen, currently polling third, is virulently anti-Ukrainian and supports an ""agreement"" with Russia's Vladimir Putin. In second place is conservative Karol Nawrocki, who opposes EU and Nato membership for Ukraine and financial assistance for refugees, but supports the war effort. The most pro-Ukraine candidate is front-runner Rafal Trzaskowski from Prime Minister Donald Tusk's coalition, although even he has promised a reduction in social welfare for Ukrainians. Trzaskowski has refrained from espousing his pro-Ukrainian credentials in order to attract the centrist vote in the elections, says political analyst Marcin Zaborowski. ""He's responding to the change in public attitudes. The initial enthusiasm for supporting war victims is disappearing, negative sentiments are taking over and it's not an entirely comfortable issue for him."" Another far-right candidate, Grzegorz Braun, is under investigation by police for tearing down a Ukrainian flag from a city hall building during an election rally in April. Braun, who is polling at just 3%, regularly fulminates against what he calls the ""Ukrainisation of Poland"".

"DNC might redo vice-chair elections, putting Hogg and Kenyatta's roles in jeopardy",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/dnc-subcommittee-recommends-redoing-vice-chair-elections-putting/story?id=121751231,ABC News,"Brittany Shepherd, Oren Oppenheim",2025-05-13T19:17:47Z,"Hogg claimed the vote can't be disentangled from his dispute with the party.

The Democratic National Committee's Credentials subcommittee has recommended that the party should once again hold vice-chair elections over complaints that there were issues with how the balloting was conducted -- a move that places its vice chairs David Hogg and Malcolm Kenyatta in jeopardy of losing their positions.

The recommendation, made after the committee's vote on Monday, comes after the party-wide officer races in February. The subcommittee's deliberations were based on a challenge filed by vice chair candidate Kalyn Free on how the election was conducted.

Free's counsel argued that the way some of the voting was conducted allowed Hogg and Kenyatta to unfairly receive more votes than Free, who also sought a vice-chair role.

The resolution is not the final decision and neither Kenyatta nor Hogg are stripped of their titles in the meantime; it will have to be adopted or rejected by the entire DNC body in an electronic or in-person vote. The timing of this wider vote is unclear, but party officials said in statements after the vote that they want to act quickly.

The vote was based on a challenge Free filed in late February, before the eruption of a dispute between Hogg, whose separate organization Leaders We Deserve is supporting primary challengers to Democratic incumbents, and others in the party who believe the DNC needs to remain neutral.

But Hogg, a Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting survivor who aims to reform the Democratic Party, claimed Monday that the committee vote can't be disentangled from his dispute with the party.

""While this vote was based on how the DNC conducted its officers' elections, which I had nothing to do with, it is also impossible to ignore the broader context of my work to reform the party which loomed large over this vote,"" Hogg said in a statement after Monday's vote.

Hogg argued that because of his announcement that his organization would support primary challengers, the DNC has ""made it clear they were going to remove me… I ran to be DNC Vice Chair to help make the Democratic Party better, not to defend an indefensible status quo that has caused voters in almost every demographic group to move away from us. The DNC has pledged to remove me, and this vote has provided an avenue to fast-track that effort.""

Kenyatta, in a thread posted on X late Monday night, said he respects the vote, but is frustrated by it. He criticized the focus on Hogg, emphasizing his own work as a vice chair.

""I disagree with the ruling, but ultimately the committee voted and I respect their votes -- even when I really disagree. Second, the press has been breathless in covering the main character they've chosen -- David Hogg. They are rushing to do it again. I call BS,"" Kenyatta, a Pennsylvania state representative, wrote.

Kenyatta called the committee's move a ""slap in the face."" He added that he has done the work to keep the vice chair job and is ""frustrated"" Hogg wants to make it all about him.

In a statement to ABC News early Tuesday morning, Free, the DNC member and vice chair candidate who initially challenged the results, applauded the credentials committee for ""righting this wrong.""

Free wrote, ""I have always known that the Democratic Party is the party of free and fair elections. Today, the credentials committee of the DNC confirmed that correcting mistakes in process, and protecting democracy is more important than saving face. This was never about Malcolm Kenyatta or David Hogg. For me, this was about ensuring that the Democratic Party lives up to our ideals as the only political party to believe in and stand up for a free and fair democracy.""

In response to the decision, DNC Chair Ken Martin said he was ""disappointed to learn that before I became Chair, there was a procedural error in the February Vice Chair elections.""

He added: ""I thank all of our officers for their service, including Vice Chairs Kenyatta and Hogg, and look forward to continuing to work with them in their officer posts as this matter is resolved.""",Credentials subcommittee recommended that the party should once again hold vice-chair elections over complaints that there were issues with how the balloting was conducted -- a move that places its vice chair David Hogg and Malcolm Kenyatta in jeopardy of losing their positions.

The newly elected Pope Leo XIV, born in Chicago as Robert Prevost, is registered to vote in the United States and has previously voted in some Republican primaries, but he is not registered as a member of a political party, and his voter history does not indicate whom he voted for or why.

According to the Illinois State Board of Elections, there is no party registration in the state. Voters can choose only one party's ballot during each primary, but that does not restrict which party's ballot a voter is allowed to choose in subsequent primaries.

ABC News obtained Leo's voter history from the Will County Clerk's office, which is the current local election authority for him. (The office provided it in response to an inquiry referencing claims about Leo circulating online after he was announced as the new pope, and the records include a date of birth that matches Leo's.)

Leo voted in the 2024 general election, the 2018 general election, the 2016 Republican primary, the 2014 general election and Republican primary and the 2012 general election and Republican primary, according to the voter history from the Will County Clerk's Office.

The voting history does not say or indicate anything about how Leo voted in each election, why he voted in some elections and not in others or if he affiliates with any specific party, given that he would not have registered with any party in Illinois when registering to vote. ABC News has not obtained records showing which elections he voted in before 2012.

Leo could still vote in future elections.

A voter living abroad can continue voting by mail as long as the voter maintains his or her voting address in Illinois, according to a spokesperson for the Illinois State Board of Elections. If that voter relinquishes his or her Illinois address, that voter's right to vote for federal offices would still be protected under the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act.

The new pope's personal politics are not known.

Prior to being elected pontiff, Leo had a presence on Twitter, and later X, where he sometimes shared messages that appeared to be critical of some of President Donald Trump's policies.

Trump and Vance have both congratulated Leo. Various cardinals have indicated, separately, that they believe Leo will be able to build a connection with Trump.

Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York told reporters on Friday, ""Will he want to build bridges to Donald Trump? I suppose that he would want to build bridges with the leader of every nation.""

Cardinal Charles Maung Bo, archbishop of Yangon in Myanmar, told ABC News' James Longman that he believes Leo can ""build a bridge"" and have a dialogue with Trump.

Denyer won't seek re-election as Green Party co-leader,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqxejw1gvd8o,BBC News,,2025-05-08T09:34:30Z,"Denyer won't seek re-election as Green Party co-leader

Jeff Overs/BBC

Carla Denyer has announced she will not stand again as co-leader of the Green Party of England and Wales, saying she wants to focus on her role as an MP. The MP for Bristol Central was one of four Greens elected in last year's general election - the party's best ever result. She was elected by party members as co-leader alongside Adrian Ramsay in 2021. On Monday current deputy leader Zack Polanski launched his leadership campaign, saying the party was sometimes ""too polite"" and needed to be ""bolder"".

The Green Party of England and Wales normally elects co-leaders every two years but Ramsay and Denyer were initially elected for a three-year term, with members then voting not to choose new leaders in 2024 because of the general election. Nominations for the next contest open on 2 June, with party members voting throughout August before the results are announced on 2 September. Under party rules, there can be one leader but if two co-leaders are elected they must be of different genders.

Denyer said it had been ""an enormous privilege"" to serve as co-leader. ""We've achieved so much, taking the party from one MP to four, from 450 councillors to over 850, and winning nearly two million votes at the last general election. But this is just the start for me and the party,"" she said in a statement. ""I've decided that for the next few years, the best way I can serve the party and the country is to pour all of my skills, passion and energy into being the best MP I can be, in Parliament and in Bristol Central."" She said British politics was at ""a critical juncture"" with voters looking for ""real alternatives"". ""In this new five-party political system it's all to play for,"" she added. Denyer was elected to Parliament for the first time last year, alongside Ramsay in Waveney Valley, Sian Berry in Brighton Pavilion and Ellie Chowns In North Herefordshire. In a statement, Ramsay thanked Denyer for her ""inspirational leadership"". ""Carla has done so much to prove we can take our values to the wider audience needed to win - and to give us the credible, Parliament-based leadership we need to win even bigger,"" he said. Despite the Greens' electoral success, there have been some internal divisions behind the scenes over issues including the party's stance on gender and trans rights. The Greens have also faced challenges balancing their coalition of voters, which now encompasses cities like Bristol as well as more rural areas like Ramsay's seat. Ramsay has been vocal in his opposition to new pylons in his constituency, which some have seen as in conflict with the party's support for renewable energy.

Polanski praised Denyer as ""a brilliant leader"", who ""cut through in 2024"". Launching his own leadership campaign on Monday, Polanski said the party needed to build a ""mass movement"" to counter Nigel Farage's Reform UK party. He told the BBC his party's results in last week's local elections had been ""solid"" but ""incremental change can't be the Green Party's future"". ""It's important we're being really intentional about our challenge to power and excess wealth,"" he said. ""We need to provide a real alternative to the two-party system and a real alternative to Reform."" It comes after the Green Party increased its number of councillors for the eighth year in a row in last week's local elections in parts of England. The party had hoped to also build on its success in south-west England, where the Greens are the biggest party on Bristol City Council and Denyer is an MP. However, it missed out in the West of England mayoral race, coming third behind Labour and Reform UK.","Carla Denyer has announced she will not stand again as co-leader of the Green Party of England and Wales, saying she wants to focus on her role as an MP.

Chris Mason: Can UK-India trade deal mask Labour's problems at home?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2e2e5rp71o,BBC News,,2025-05-07T05:46:49Z,"Chris Mason: Can Delhi deal mask Labour's problems at home?

In response to last week's elections, they are publicly critical of the government, including its handling of the removal of the Winter Fuel Payment from millions of pensioners.

The latest intervention comes from a caucus of Labour MPs known as the Red Wall Group , primarily representing seats in the north of England and the Midlands.

Little wonder ministers want to lean into this deal with Delhi, grappling as they are with political heat at home from their own side and their opponents.

Within moments of the briefing with the business secretary beginning, Jonathan Reynolds described it to us as a case study in the government's claim to be going further and faster in doing what it can to improve living standards.

Jonathan Reynolds wants to point to what he sees as the ""tangible benefits"" of making it easier for the fifth and sixth largest economies in the world to trade and made a point of claiming it would be the north of England, the Midlands and Scotland that would be the primary economic beneficiaries.

But remember this is the ""conclusion of talks moment,"" as it is described in government, not the conclusion of the deal.

Thousands of pages of text still need to be pored over and vast amounts of detail scrutinised.

And there will, in time, be a signature moment, hinted at by the prime minister in publicly accepting an invitation to visit India.

It is thought it could be another year before this is done.

The domestic political reaction to this deal has focused on one element of it: an agreement that India workers transferred to the UK and their employers won't have to pay national insurance in the UK in their first three years here.

This, the Conservative leader and former business secretary Kemi Badenoch argued, is ""lop sided"" and why she didn't sign off on the deal when she was in government.

The Liberal Democrats and Reform UK have also criticised this part of the agreement.

British officials acknowledge this is an element of the deal India really wanted, but they argue it is worth it in the round and standard practice in deals like this.

And, strikingly, the Conservative reaction isn't consistent: Sir Oliver Dowden, who sat around the same cabinet table as Kemi Badenoch as deputy prime minister, welcomed it.

There are a few key bits of context to this deal and one final observation I would make.

The context is this: the ongoing turbulence of President Trump's tariffs and the ongoing negotiations with both the United States and the European Union over improving trade deals with both.

Progress on both is expected soon – a summit with the EU will take place in the UK later this month.

And that one last thing.

Sir Keir Starmer voted against Brexit and campaigned for another referendum in the hope of stopping it.

And yet, in a twist of fate and timing, he is the first post-Brexit British prime minister to have the political space and time to grapple with the tools leaving the EU gave whoever occupies his office, with the trade-offs and arguments that brings.","Chris Mason: Can Delhi deal mask Labour's problems at home?

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said he's glad no one could tell what he was thinking when he met President Donald Trump at the White House on Tuesday.

""I am glad you could not tell what was going through my mind,"" Carney told a reporter after she had asked him about his thoughts at the meeting when Trump said he wanted Canada to be a part of the US.

During their meeting, Carney repeatedly told Trump that Canada was not for sale. In addition to threatening and imposing tariffs on Canada, Trump has also talked about adopting Canada as the 51st US state.

""The president has made known his wish about that issue for some time. I have been careful, always, to distinguish between wish and reality,"" Carney said at a doorstop interview after his meeting with Trump.

""I was clear there in the Oval Office as I have been clear throughout on behalf of Canadians that this is never gonna happen. Canada is not for sale and never will be for sale,"" Carney continued.

Earlier, Carney and Trump held a joint press conference after a meeting at the Oval Office. Trump told reporters he still believes Canada should be the 51st US state, but added that ""it takes two to tango.""

""It would really be a wonderful marriage because it's two places, they get along very well. They like each other a lot,"" Trump said.

Carney was seen pursing his lips, but kept his expression neutral as Trump spoke.

""As you know from real estate, there are some places that are never for sale. We're sitting in one right now. You know, Buckingham Palace, that you visited as well,"" Carney said in response to Trump.

""And having met with the owners of Canada over the course of the campaign the last several months, it's not for sale and won't be for sale ever. But the opportunity is the partnership and what we can build together,"" Carney added.

Carney took over as the leader of Canada's ruling Liberal Party from his predecessor, Justin Trudeau, in March. Trudeau faced repeated calls to step down after his deputy prime minister, Chrystia Freeland, resigned from his cabinet in December.

The Liberal Party was initially lagging behind its opponents, the Conservative Party, in the polls. But Trump's aggressive tariffs may well have helped turn the tables.

Trump's rhetoric and threats sparked nationalistic fervor among Canadians, who boycotted US goods and renewed their support for the Liberal Party. The party was able to form a minority government after it won 169 out of 343 parliamentary seats in the April elections.

""As I've been warning for months, America wants our land, our resources, our water, our country. Never. But these are not idle threats. President Trump is trying to break us so that America can own us. That will never, ever happen,"" Carney said in his victory speech on April 29.

Germany's parliament is set to elect conservative Friedrich Merz as new Chancellor. The 69-year old is promising to revitalize the country's flagging economy and boost its voice on the world stage. It brings an end to Germany's recent political limbo after the last government collapsed. But Merz takes office at a time of huge uncertainty abroad and a surging far-right at home.

""It's our historical duty to make this government a success,"" said the CDU leader on Monday, as he officially signed the coalition agreement. Merz's supporters argue that what they see as good government can help address growing voter discontent. ""I think we really need to prove that we solve the problems, not in a radical way, just in a very responsible, visible, detailed way,"" says Mark Helfrich, a CDU member of the Bundestag. But the CDU, CSU and SPD coalition have a narrow majority with 328 seats – just a dozen more than the minimum required.

In February's federal election, the CDU/CSU nudged up its support by just four points while coalition partner, the SPD, crashed to its worst post-war result. Merz has promised to tighten immigration rules, invest in the nation's ailing infrastructure and rebuild ties with key European partners. He already steered through a law to exempt defence and security from Germany's strict debt rules – knowing that in the new parliament he wouldn't be able to find the necessary majority to do so. ""A remarkable decision,"" says Claudia Major, a senior vice-president at the German Marshall Fund in Berlin. But because support for the governing parties is relatively low, ""Merz will need to convince the broader public of the necessity to spend more on defence"".

Merz will continue to invest in Germany's relationship with the US, says Claudia Major

Snapping at Merz's heels throughout this parliament will be the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), now the main opposition force in the Bundestag. The AfD wants to close Germany's borders, deport migrants en masse, end weapons supplies to Ukraine and re-open ties with Putin's Russia. Last week, the AfD was officially classed as an extremist organisation by domestic intelligence (BfV), re-igniting a debate about whether the party should be banned. The AfD has now said it's suing the BfV, accusing it of an ""abuse"" of power. And the designation was publicly denounced by senior figures in Donald Trump's US administration – including vice president JD Vance. Managing relationships with Trump's White House will be another balancing act for Merz, a committed Atlanticist who raised eyebrows on election night when he declared Europe should ""achieve independence from the USA"". Nevertheless, Merz's government will ""invest a lot to keep the transatlantic relationship going"" says the GMF's Claudia Major. There's speculation he may even ""go for golf"" – a reference to seeking to woo golf-mad Trump by playing some holes out on the fairway. But Merz's first trips abroad are set to be to Paris and Warsaw, relationships he claims suffered under Olaf Scholz. It's ""high time"" to improve German-Polish relations, says Agnieszka Pomaska, a member of Prime Minister Donald Tusk's Civic Platform party who chairs the European Union Affairs Committee in the Polish parliament. ""We need to invest together in the army, in defence,"" says Pomaska, who says that Scholz's government was ""politically weak"" and ""it's never easy to cooperate with a government that is simply weak"". ""We didn't have this feeling that was very much present during previous years that Germany is one of the leaders in the European Union.""","Germany's parliament is set to elect conservative Friedrich Merz as new Chancellor.

Trump says 'I don't know'

toggle caption Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP

President Trump — when asked on ""Meet the Press with Kristen Welker"" if he thinks he needs to uphold the Constitution — said, ""I don't know,"" but added that his lawyers ""are obviously going to follow what the Supreme Court said.""

The response came after a series of questions regarding the right to due process for people living in the United States and the Fifth Amendment. During this exchange, Trump said he wants to deport millions of undocumented immigrants — who he called ""some of the worst people on Earth.""

""I was elected to get them the hell out of here and the courts are holding me from doing it,"" Trump said.

Immigration enforcement was one of the top issues ahead of the 2024 presidential elections. It has been a strong issue for Trump, but recent polls show that Americans are disapproving of his handling of immigration.

Welker then pressed Trump on whether he, as president, needs to abide by the Constitution and the rights it provides to people in the U.S.

""I don't know,"" Trump said. ""I have to respond by saying, again, I have brilliant lawyers that work for me, and they are going to obviously follow what the Supreme Court said. What you said is not what I heard the Supreme Court said. They have a different interpretation.""

During the wide-ranging interview with NBC News, Trump also ruled out running for a third term — which the Constitution prohibits.

""This is not something I'm looking to do,"" Trump said. ""I'm looking to have four great years and turn it over to somebody.""

Previously, Trump said he was ""not joking"" about a third term and contended ""there are methods.""

When asked about his successor, Trump complimented both Vice President Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

""JD's doing a fantastic job,"" he said. ""Marco is great. … We have a lot of good people in this party.""

On the economy, Trump blamed former President Joe Biden for the ""bad parts,"" while taking credit for ""good parts"" of the economy.

""Ultimately, I take responsibility for everything,"" Trump said when pressed by Welker. ""But I've only just been here for a little more than three months.""

Trump also celebrated his tariff policies — which have roiled financial markets and increased the possibility of a recession. He said the tariffs could be permanent.

Last week, the Commerce Department reported that the U.S. economy shrank by a annual rate of 0.3% in the first quarter of the year.

""The fake news was giving me such press on the tariffs,"" Trump said. ""The tariffs are going to make us rich. We're going to be a very rich country.""

When asked if the president believes a recession in the short term could benefit the country long term, Trump said the country is in a time of transformation.

""Look, yeah, it's everything's OK,"" he said. ""What we are. I said, this is a transition period. I think we're going to do fantastically.""

The president continued his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for not lowering interest rates as quickly as Trump would like, but the president notably said he has no plans to remove Powell before the end of his term in 2026. Previously, Trump threatened to terminate the chairman — sending shockwaves in the markets over worries that the Federal Reserve would lose its independence.

Later in the interview, Trump refused to rule out the use of military force on Greenland and said, ""it could happen.""

""We need Greenland very badly,"" he said. ""Greenland is a very small amount of people, which we'll take care of, and we'll cherish them, and all of that. But we need that for international security.""

Trump also said he plans to continue to talk about annexing Canada and making it the 51st state, but he said it's ""highly unlikely"" he'd use military force against Canada. Trump is set to meet with newly elect Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney soon.

When asked about worries that he is taking the country down an authoritarian path, Trump rebuffed the suggestion.

Welker then asked Trump whether he believes his critics have the right to speak against him without fear of retribution.

Labour minister sorry over grooming gangs remark,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2ew9jnj2p1o,BBC News,,2025-05-03T21:06:23Z,"Labour minister sorry over grooming gangs remark

Listen to heated row between Lucy Powell and Tim Montgomerie

Leader of the House of Commons Lucy Powell has sought to clarify her remarks after she appeared to describe grooming gangs as a ""dog whistle"" issue, prompting a backlash from political opponents. During a heated debate on BBC Radio 4's Any Questions on Friday, commentator and Reform UK member Tim Montgomerie asked Powell if she had seen a recent Channel 4 documentary on grooming gangs. Powell responded ""oh, we want to blow that little trumpet now do we"" and ""let's get that dog whistle out shall we"". But on Saturday, the Labour minister said she regarded child exploitation and grooming with the ""utmost seriousness"", adding: ""I'm sorry if this was unclear.""

Powell said: ""I was challenging the political point scoring around it, not the issue itself. As a constituency MP I've dealt with horrendous cases."" Health Secretary Wes Streeting said politicians sometimes say things ""in the heat of debate"" that ""come across badly"". ""She's mortified and she does not want and would not want people who've campaigned on, or been victims of, these most appalling crimes to think she was in any way trying to undermine those experiences or those arguments,"" he told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg. During the political debate programme, Montgomerie was asked about Reform UK's pledge to replicate the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) - including by cutting diversity and inclusions roles within councils - following its successes in Thursday's local elections. Montgomerie said the UK was ""one of the most tolerant [countries] in the world"", but argued there ""always needs to be more progress on racial issues"". He said: ""It's not so much the amount of money that is spent on employing diversity officers. ""You talk to a lot of civil servants, the amount of time they now have to spend monitoring this issue [of diversity] above all others is an extraordinary diversion."" Powell called his claims ""absolutely rubbish"", and told Montgomerie to spend a day with council staff to ""actually see what they're dealing with"". Montgomerie then asked Powell if she ""saw the documentary on Channel 4 about rape gangs"", to which she responded: ""Oh, we want to blow that little trumpet now do we. Let's get that dog whistle out shall we.""","Leader of the House of Commons Lucy Powell has sought to clarify her remarks after she appeared to describe grooming gangs as a ""dog whistle"" issue.",Negative,0.9972350001335144,"trump, said, carney"

In the first week of 2025, Nigel Farage told me his ultimate goal was to become prime minister. It stuck in my mind that he chose to add: ""I'm not joking."" Nobody in the two traditional main parties finds his stunning success this week funny. ""Farage is no longer someone we can just laugh off,"" a former Conservative cabinet minister told me. If the idea of Farage in No 10 seemed outlandish in January, the backing of millions of voters this week shows it's not a wild notion. The next General Election is, of course, miles away. Parties can surge and sink. But this week's results show that Farage has changed the race. For Labour, it's a race to prove that government can actually be a force for good. Minister after minister trotted out the same lines as the results came in – waiting lists are starting to come down, the minimum wage has gone up, and new breakfast clubs are opening in schools. I could almost recite their script by the end of our election coverage. There is little appetite in No 10 to budge on any of the big decisions they've already made, however many times internal critics, and increasing numbers of loyalists, complain about cutting winter fuel payments or raising employer National Insurance contributions. But Downing Street is desperate to show that despite its unpopularity in the polls and grisly performance in real elections, there are signs of progress. Labour is well aware its main rival at the next election could be Reform, not the Tories – the disappointment and disillusionment felt by some in the UK finding a voice in Farage. Yet has the party's top brass understood how serious the threat could be?

PA Media Reform candidate Sarah Pochin received 38.7% of the vote in the Runcorn by-election, with the Conservatives finishing third and Green Party in fourth

One party veteran suggests it's only ""just starting to dawn"" on those at the top, warning ""the coming years could be existential for Labour"". While the government can 'do', opposition parties can only 'say'. For the Tories it's now a race to look like a serious outfit and for Kemi Badenoch it's a race to become not just a leader who voters recognise, but one they warm to. In politics it's often said you're quick or you're dead – but the Conservative leader's pitch to her party was ""Renewal 2030"", and she's repeatedly suggested her approach is to have a long, hard think about what the party should do next. There is a push for Badenoch to do more faster, and to be more visible. A former council leader has called for her to resign. Another said the ""main part of the job is grabbing attention – it doesn't matter what you do if no-one sees or hears"". Badenoch will join us on Sunday's programme alongside Health Secretary Wes Streeting, Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey, Green co-leader Adrian Ramsay and Zia Yusuf, chairman of Reform UK.

Pollsters report that six months into the job, Badenoch is still an unknown for huge numbers of voters. Farage is a past master at grabbing headlines, seizing on issues other politicians are sometimes reluctant to, talking in terms that raise eyebrows, creating rows and news coverage. Reform has already been ahead of the Conservatives in the polls for months – and many Tories acknowledge privately it's not impossible that Farage's party could replace them in the medium term. It's ""not inevitable"", one of the former ministers said, ""but we have to throw everything at it to make sure it doesn't happen, not just hope or guess"".

Reuters Reform UK also won its first parliamentary by-election, narrowly taking Runcorn and Helsby from Labour by just six votes after a recount

PA Media And it won its first mayoral race, with former Conservative MP Dame Andrea Jenkyns taking 42% of the vote in Greater Lincolnshire

The race for Reform is to show that they can go beyond effective campaigning to running things. When they walk over the threshold of county halls and mayors' offices for the first time, they cross the threshold from being a party of protest to a party with responsibility. They have built a campaigning machine, a brand, and a platform at breakneck speed with lots of money to spend. But being in charge, making choices that affect voters' lives directly, is a different job. We know relatively little about how they'll operate beyond promises of opening the books, Elon Musk-style, and rooting out waste. When pressed for what that would mean, Reform has mentioned council equality officers being axed, and cutting spending on cycle lanes or traffic calming zones. When asked how they would close asylum hotels, as promised in the parts of the country they'll run, Richard Tice, the deputy leader, said: ""I'll come back to you."" One of Reform's new mayors, Dame Andrea Jenkyns, suggested migrants could be housed in tents instead. With responsibility comes scrutiny, and you can bet the other parties will be watching like hawks and seize on any mishaps.

But this week's extraordinary success for Reform UK is leading an increasing number of politicians in the two traditional big parties to ponder how deep the public's disillusionment really is with the political system – and what they can really do to address it. One member of the government told me they have to deal with ""anger and frustration. Rebellion. Patriotism. A big four years coming up"". A shadow minister, referring to both the Tories and Labour, said: ""We're not connecting and politics isn't working… either Labour will be able to get themselves sorted and show government can work, or Reform will win."" The Liberal Democrats had impressive advances this week too, and the Greens made some steady progress. The elections were only in England and at a UK-wide level the jigsaw is already much more complicated. But voters' decisions this week have shaken the central dynamic in our national politics, which is always, in the end, a fight between one big bloc on the left and one big bloc on the right. Our two-party system has been declared over on many previous occasions – then miraculously survived. But after this week, you wouldn't say it could never happen. That week back in January when Farage declared he wanted to get into No 10, a senior government figure told me that their party ""mustn't over think the threat"" Reform posed. After this week, that is a phrase they'd be unlikely to repeat.
